# BuffBot üêçü§ñ
Discord is a great communication software itself, however, it does not provide some much wanted features. Some Discord servers may have several hundred members, if all of these users were to join the same voice channel, there would likely be several conversations taking place at the same time. On the other hand, some voice channels may have as little as one, two or three participants, opening the possibility for awkward silent moments.
 
Would it not be great if users could share their music with their fellow gamers, especially during awkward silent moments? Would it not be great if players were automatically sorted into voice channels allocated the game they are playing, instead of everyone manually creating and changing voice channels? 
 
BuffBot is the solution to these lacking features. BuffBot provides features like streaming music into voice channels, queuing songs to a playlist, administrate users into voice channels based on what they do, a global server economy, interacting with the bot through mini games that can earn you an advantage in the global server economy.

We have many great features we would like to implement to the bot in the future, such as an [online management tool UI](https://github.com/Cmoen11/BuffBot/issues/56).   
We'd love your help, whether you've got a bug or a feature you'd like fixed, or if you'd like to contribute through developing the BuffBot yourself. <br>
<b>However</b>, please read and respect the [Contribution](#contribution) first.
